# GPD-bar-chart

A bar chart made with D3.js for national GDP of the USA

## This was done as a project for [Free Code Camp](https://www.freecodecamp.org)

This is the first project from the Data Visualization Projects of Free Code Camp
You need to build a bar chart for the US GDP-_Gross Domestic Product_ using a preset dataset supplied by Free Code Camp here [https://raw.githubusercontent.com/freeCodeCamp/ProjectReferenceData/master/GDP-data.json](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/freeCodeCamp/ProjectReferenceData/master/GDP-data.json)

**Here are a list of the User Stories required**

- User Story #1: My chart should have a title with a corresponding `id="title"`
- User Story #2: My chart should have a `g` element x-axis with a corresponding `id="x-axis"`.
- User Story #3: My chart should have a `g` element y-axis with a corresponding `id="y-axis"`.
- User Story #4: Both axes should contain multiple tick labels, each with the corresponding `class="tick"`.
- User Story #5: My chart should have a `rect` element for each data point with a corresponding `class="bar"` displaying the data.
- User Story #6: Each bar should have the properties `data-date` and `data-gdp` containing date and GDP values.
- User Story #7: The bar elements' `data-date` properties should match the order of the provided data.
- User Story #8: The bar elements' `data-gdp` properties should match the order of the provided data.
- User Story #9: Each bar element's height should accurately represent the data's corresponding GDP.
- User Story #10: The `data-date` attribute and its corresponding bar element should align with the corresponding value on the x-axis.
- User Story #11: The `data-gdp` attribute and its corresponding bar element should align with the corresponding value on the y-axis.
- User Story #12: I can mouse over an area and see a tooltip with a corresponding `id="tooltip"` which displays more information about the area.
- User Story #13: My tooltip should have a `data-date` property that corresponds to the `data-date` of the active area.
